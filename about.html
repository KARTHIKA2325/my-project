    <p>Technology and innovation are closely related, with technology being a key driver of innovation. Technological innovation is the process of creating new or improved products or services. 
        
        
        
        Disruptive innovation: Involves new ideas that lead to significant changes in products, services, or processes. This can transform markets, companies, and user behavior. 
        Incremental changes: Involve cycles of small changes that can enhance existing knowledge. 
        Technological discontinuities: Involve changes that can make existing knowledge obsolete.

        For Example:
        Internet of Things (IoT)
Enables communication between devices, machines, and humans. IoT is used in homes, agriculture, logistics, and energy management. 
Blockchain
A decentralized digital ledger that securely stores records across a network of computers. It's used in supply chain management, healthcare, and voting systems. 
Benefits of technological innovation: 
Automating repetitive tasks
Eliminating manual processes
Reducing operational errors
Speeding up processes
Improving communication
Creating new products and services


The Industrial Revolution led to many improvements, including increased production, better transportation, and improved living standards. 
Improved production
Factory system: Large factories powered by steam engines replaced small workshops, enabling mass production 
Spinning jenny, flying shuttle, water frame, and power loom: These innovations made weaving cloth and spinning yarn and thread faster and easier 
Sewing machine: This machine enabled factories to produce clothing on a much larger scale
